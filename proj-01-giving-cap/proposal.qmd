## Dataset

This dataset comes from a 2023 survey conducted by world champion barista James Hoffmann and coffee company Cometeer. The participants were told to fill out a survey where they described 4 coffees they ordered from Cometeer. They described several factors such as their coffee preferences, brewing methods, spending habits, and demographic details. Additionally, they described the coffeeâ€™s bitterness, acidity, and their personal preference rating.

The dimensions of the dataset are 4042 responses to 57 columns.

We chose the coffee dataset because it contains a large amount of structured data on coffee quality, demographics, and attributes, making it ideal for analysis. Additionally, the dataset's detailed attributes make it well-suited for data visualization and statistical analysis.

The explanations for columns are included in the data README file.

## Questions

1.  What are the coffee consumption patterns of individuals with different demographics?
- Demographic
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Ethncity_race
  - Employment_status
  - Number_children
  - Political_affiliation
  - Education_level
- Potential comparison 
  - Most_willing
  - Most_paid

2.  How do factors like work from home or in person and employment status influence an individual's overall coffee preference on dairy type, strength,caffeine, sweetener, style, and roast level?
- Preference
  - Strength
  - Roast_level
  - Dairy
  - Sweetener
  - Caffeine
  - Style
- Work Condition
  - employment_status
  - wfh(work from home or in person)


## Analysis plan

### Question 1

**step 1: Data cleaning**

Check and handle the missing values. Convert the categorical variables into meaningful groups

Since the educational_level contains multiple text-based categories, we will group them into three levels:

- Low Education(Less than high school/High school graduate)
- Medium Education(Some college or associate's degree/Bachelor's degree)
- High Education(Master's degree/Doctorate or professional degree)

For other variables, we will keep their original categorical values.

Demographic variables:
- Age(<18 / 18-24 / 25-34 / 35-44 / 45-54 / 55-64 / >65)
- Gender(Male / Female / Non-binary)
- Ethnicity_race(White or Caucasian / Asian or Pacific Islander / Hispanic or Latino / Black or African American / Other)
- Number_children(NA / 1 / 2 / 3 / >3)
- Political_affiliation(Independent / No affiliation / Republican / Democrat)
- Educational_level(Low / Medium / High)

Coffee consumption variables:

- Most_willing($10-$15 / $15-$20 / $2-$4 / $4-$6 / $6-$8 / $8-$10 / Less than $2 / More than $20)
- Most_paid($10-$15 / $15-$20 / $2-$4 / $4-$6 / $6-$8 / $8-$10 / Less than $2 / More than $20)

Calculate the frequency of and count proportion for each of the categorical variables


**step 2: Bivariate analysis**

Compare total spending and willingness to pay across age groups, genders, and political affiliations using violin plots

-   X: demographics group
-   Y: spending category


### Question 2

**step 1: Data cleaning**

Data cleaning the columns and removing all the null values. Group the data into meaningful categories (strength, caffeine, etc)

Potential Continuous/Discrete Variables

- Strength (Weak / Somewhat light / Medium / Somewhat strong / Very Strong)
- Caffeine (Full caffeine / Half caff / Decaf)

Discrete Variables

- Dairy (Whole milk / Half and half / Oat milk / Skim milk / Almond milk / Soy milk / Flavored coffee creamer / Coffee creamer)
- Sweetener (Granulated Sugar / Artificial Sweeteners (e.g., Splenda) / Stevia / Raw Sugar (Turbinado) / Brown Sugar / Agave Nectar / Honey / Maple Syrup)
- Roast level (Light / Blonde / Medium / Nordic / Dark / Italian / French)
- Style (Complex / Light / Sweet / Full Bodied / Fruity / Bright / Nutty / Caramelized / Bold / Chocolatey / Floral / Juicy)

Work Condition Variables

- employment_status (Employed full-time / Unemployed / Student / Employed part-time / Retired / Homemaker)
- wfh (Home / In Person / Mix)

Calculate the frequency of and count proportion for each of the categorical variables

**step 2: Visualization**

-   Faceting Plots: Stacked Bar plots
    -   X: employment_status and wfh
    -   Y: Preferences
    -   Plots: each bar will be representing the frequency of different preferences depending on work conditions.
