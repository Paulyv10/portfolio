## ☕ Introduction {.center style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 0px;"}

::: {style="margin-top: 40px;"} 
**Data source:**
:::

::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
-   Survey conducted by world champion barista James Hoffmann in 2023 on his YouTube channel.
-   Contains data about coffee spending habits, coffee preferences, and demographic factors of American respondents.
:::

**Why analyze coffee spending and preference patterns?**

::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
-   Coffee is a daily ritual for millions worldwide, yet we don't know how others experience it.
-   Curiosity drove us to explore how coffee-related habits vary across demographics and lifestyles.
:::

## ☕ Q1: How Does Coffee Spending Vary Based On Gender, Ethnicity, and Race? {.center style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 0px;"}

::: {style="margin-top: 40px;"}  
**Why This Question Matters:**  
:::

::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
-   There are common stereotypes about certain genders and ethnicities consuming more coffee than others. We wanted to explore whether this dataset supports or challenges these assumptions.
:::

**Key Dataset Variables:**

::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
-   `total_spend` (Monthly average coffee spending)
-   `ethnicity_race`
-   `gender`
:::

## ☕ Q1: Coffee Spending by Gender, Ethnicity, and Race {.center style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 0px;"}

```{r,  echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%", out.height="70%"}

knitr::include_graphics("lineplot_1.png")
```
::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
- Female respondents show more variation across racial/ethnic groups compared to males
- Lack of non-binary respondents for certain ethnic/racial groups
- The plot shows diverse spending patterns across demographics, but due to the uneven sample sizes the data is not robust enough to confirm or challenge existing stereotypes.

## ☕ Q2: How Does Work Arrangement Influence Coffee Taste Preferences and Spending Habits? {.center style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 0px;"}

::: {style="margin-top: 40px;"}  
**Why This Question Matters:**  
:::

::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
-   There are assumptions that remote workers spend more on coffee or prefer different styles than in-person workers. We wanted to explore how work settings impact coffee habits.
:::

**Key Dataset Variables:**

::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
-   `wfh` (Categorizes respondents as working from home, in-person, or a mix of both (hybrid)
-   `style` (Coffee flavor style preference)
-   `avg_total_spend` (Total monthly coffee spending per style)
:::

## ☕ Q2: Coffee Spending by Work Arrangement, Taste Preferences, and Spending Habits {.center style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 0px;"}

```{r,  echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width="70%", out.height="70%"}

knitr::include_graphics("problem_2.png")
```
::: {style="font-size:70%;"}
- Hybrid workers spend the most on coffee on average, while in-person workers spend the least.
- The priciest coffee style varies: Floral for in-person, Bright for remote, and Juicy for hybrid workers.
- Hybrid workers show the widest spending range, while in-person workers have the most consistent spending.
