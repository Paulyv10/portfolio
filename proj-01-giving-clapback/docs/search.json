We chose this dataset as it clearly outlines all of relevant columns that we may need such as the country, location of the game. The main important columns that are included are the sports,event and medals columns.

Since this question explores only developing countries, we will need an outside dataset and metrics to determine what classifies a country as developing. We identified a dataset from the World Bank which lists GDP per capita of each country since 1990. According to Investopedia, a many economists consider a developed country to have a GDP per capita of at least $25,000. Thus, this could be a potential cutoff to whether a country is developing or not. We will need to merge this dataset and use it to classify each country as developing or not (1 or 0). The merged dataset can then be subsetted to only account for developing nations. The extra dataset we plan to use is the Worldwide Bureaucracy Index from Tidyverse Tuesdays 2024 folder. The WBI contains information regarding each country’s income level (from low-income to high-income). Low income and medium countries will be delegated as “developing”, while high income countries will be considered “developed.” Naturally, this may be somewhat vague in the data, so for specific countries which may have high income, but are still considered “developing” on the global stage, we will make exceptions.\nIn order to visualize participation, one potential method is to sum the id column to measure the amount of athletes that participate from each country. We can use a line graph to visualize this, with the sum of the athletes being represented on the y axis, and year being represented on the x axis, since we are graphing over time. The data will be grouped by country. Another option could be to use proportional analysis by measuring the proportion of athletes from each country. This could be done by using a stacked bar chart. We can also facet by sport to display each country’s participation across the years by sport. This will add another level of nuance that could help our understanding of participation across developing countries.\nWhat is the age distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals for contact sports like Judo or Boxing?\nWe will have to: Filter the dataset to gather all sports. We will then remove missing age values. After that, we will group by “Medal” and summarize mean, median, standard deviation, min/max age, and interquartile range of age.\n\n#library(tidytuesdayR)\n#wwbi_data &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 18)\n#country_data &lt;- wwbi_data$wwbi_country\n\n#glimpse(country_data)\n\n#wwbi_country &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-04-30/wwbi_country.csv')"

We chose these two charts because of their ability to communicate the actual versus relative changes of the presence of lower-middle income and low-income countries in the Olympics. Our greatest limitation with these data was our access to the income status of countries over time. For example, China started competing in the Olympics in 1932, but its economic status has shifted wildly over the past 92 years since. Consequentially, some of our data may under-represent or over-represent the number of athletes from low-income and lower-middle-income countries.\n\nThe first\n\n\n(1-2 paragraphs) Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question.

Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nIn this analysis, we aim to examine the role of weight and height in Olympic medal winners across multiple games, focusing on whether these factors differ between male and female athletes. We are particularly interested in this question because it allows us to explore potential patterns in physical attributes among top-performing athletes and whether any gender-based discrepancies exist in contact sports.\nTo answer this question, we need several key columns from the dataset. The sport column is essential for filtering only contact sports without weight classes, as weight categories could distort our findings. We selected Basketball, Water Polo, Hockey, Football, Rugby Sevens, Ice Hockey, and Speed Skating because they all have male and female divisions. The medal column is necessary to isolate athletes who have won a medal, removing any NA values. Additionally, the sex column is crucial for comparing male and female athletes. Finally, weight and height are key factors in our analysis, but since they are recorded in metric units, we converted them to pounds and feet to align with our American audience’s familiarity with the imperial system.\n\n\nApproach\n(1-2 paragraphs) Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nTo analyze the relationship between height, weight, and Olympic medal-winning athletes across different sports and sexes, we will use two types of plots: a density plot and a hexagonal bin plot (hex plot). These visualizations will help us examine the distribution of physical attributes and their potential impact on performance while effectively handling overlapping data points.\nDensity Plot: This plot will display the distribution of weights among Olympic medalists, separated by sex. By using density curves, we can observe where most athletes’ weights are concentrated within each sport. Initially, we considered plotting all sports together, but even with transparency adjustments, the overlap made it difficult to read. To address this, we faceted the graphs by sport, allowing for clearer comparisons within each category. Additionally, we will create separate density plots for male and female athletes and then combine them using the patchwork library, ensuring a side-by-side comparison of weight distributions across sexes.\nHexagonal Bin Plot (Hex Plot): This plot will visualize the relationship between height and weight for Olympic medalists, helping us understand how these two factors interact across different sports. Instead of a scatterplot, which can become cluttered with large datasets, the hex plot groups data points into hexagonal bins and uses color intensity to indicate density. Similar to the density plot, we facet the graphs by sport and separate them by sex. To enhance comparability, we will generate separate hex plots for male and female athletes and then combine them using the patchwork library, allowing for direct visual comparison of trends between the two groups.\n\n\nAnalysis\n(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed) In this section, provide the code that generates your plots.

In Image 3, the density plots show weight distributions where men consistently have higher median weights than women in the same sports, with football (soccer) and rugby sevens displaying the most pronounced gender differences. Speed skating athletes exhibit the lowest weights overall, clustering around 150-160 lbs, likely reflecting the advantage of lower body mass for speed and agility. Notably, women’s distributions appear more staggered or multimodal (particularly evident in speed skating), reflecting the varying developmental stages of women’s sports globally and differences in athlete development across countries.\n Image 4’s hexagonal heatmaps illustrate the relationship between height and weight, showing strong positive correlations across all sports—taller athletes tend to be heavier. Basketball displays the most vertical spread, with male athletes reaching heights above 7 feet while maintaining proportionate weight-to-height ratios. The global inequality in resources dedicated to women’s sports likely contributes to less homogenized physical characteristics than we see in men’s sports, where greater competition tends to narrow the range of “successful” body types. This differential resource allocation creates distinct physical clusters in women’s sports.\nThese patterns reflect the complex interplay between biological differences, societal influences, and the evolutionary trajectory of sports on the global stage. Sport-specific positional requirements in disciplines like rugby sevens and field hockey might further explain the multimodal distributions, particularly in women’s competitions where role specialization creates distinct physical sub-populations. Women’s elite sports are still discovering their optimal physical parameters in many cases, while men’s sports have had longer to converge on “ideal” physiques through decades of competition. As women’s sports continue to develop globally with more equitable support and participation, we might see these distributions either normalize toward single modes (as in men’s sports) or maintain their distinctive patterns, establishing unique optimization strategies different from men’s competitions."
