    "text": "Results\n\n1. Salary vs. Usage Rate (Interactive)\nMethod We examine the correlation between NBA player salaries and their Player Impact Estimate (PIE), a comprehensive metric that reflects a player’s overall contribution to their team’s success. The data is visualized in a scatter plot with a linear regression line.\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- ggplot(shared_data, aes(x = USG_PCT, y = salary_num, text = tooltip_usage)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Player Usage vs. Salary\",\n       subtitle = \"Higher usage players often earn more\",\n       x = \"Usage Rate (%)\",\n       y = \"Salary (USD)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p1, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation This plot shows that the relationship between salary and PIE is not perfectly linear, as expected. While higher PIE tends to correspond with higher salaries, there are outliers, such as players with high salaries but lower PIE, likely reflecting other factors like team dynamics and marketability.\n\n\n2. Salary vs. Player Impact Estimate (PIE) – Interactive\nMethod Next, we investigate the relationship between player salary and Usage Rate, which indicates how often a player is involved in a team’s offensive possessions. This plot helps us understand if high Usage Rate leads to higher salaries or if salaries are driven by other factors.\n\n\nCode\np2 &lt;- ggplot(shared_data, aes(x = PIE, y = salary_num, text = tooltip_pie)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#1c5e91\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Salary vs. Player Impact Estimate (PIE)\",\n       x = \"Player Impact Estimate\",\n       y = \"Salary (USD)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p2, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation The scatter plot shows a moderate positive correlation between salary and Usage Rate, suggesting that players with a higher involvement in team plays tend to earn more. However, there are exceptions, such as players with high usage rates earning lower salaries, possibly due to other factors such as team strategy or market conditions.\n\n\n3. Usage and Salary vs. Team Win %\nMethod Finally, we analyze how player salary correlates with their team’s playoff success, measured by Team Playoff Win Percentage. This analysis helps determine if teams with higher-paying players tend to have better postseason success.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Filter to reduce clutter and emphasize high-usage, high-salary players\ninteractive_data &lt;- player_data %&gt;%\n  filter(salary_num &gt; 10000000 & USG_PCT &gt; 0.20)\n\n# Create tooltip text\ninteractive_data &lt;- interactive_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(tooltip = paste0(\"Player: \", PLAYER_NAME,\n                          \"\\nSeason: \", SEASON,\n                          \"\\nUsage: \", round(USG_PCT * 100, 1), \"%\",\n                          \"\\nSalary: $\", formatC(salary_num, format = \"d\", big.mark = \",\"),\n                          \"\\nTeam Win %: \", round(W_PCT, 2)))\n\n# Create plot\np3 &lt;- ggplot(interactive_data, aes(x = USG_PCT, y = W_PCT, color = salary_num, text = tooltip)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_c(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Usage and Salary vs. Team Playoff Win %\",\n       subtitle = \"Interactive view: Hover for player details\",\n       x = \"Usage Rate (%)\",\n       y = \"Team Win Percentage\",\n       color = \"Salary\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Convert to interactive\np3_interactive &lt;- ggplotly(p3, tooltip = \"text\")\np3_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** Interpretation** The plot suggests a weak correlation between player salary and team success in the playoffs, indicating that salary does not necessarily equate to playoff success. Other factors, such as team composition and player roles, likely influence a team’s performance during the postseason."

However, the relationship between salary and impact (PIE) is less consistent — many high-paid players contribute only average impact metrics in the playoffs.\nUsage rates have increased in the modern era, with players in the 2000s and later assuming significantly greater offensive responsibilities compared to pre-2000s playoff contributors.\nWhen relating player salary and usage to team playoff win percentage, no strong direct correlation emerges. This suggests that while stars are paid and used heavily, their impact on team success is conditional — likely moderated by team depth, matchup dynamics, and variance in short playoff series."

    "text": "Results\n\nPlot1: Defensive Rating vs. Career Length\nDefensive Rating: a team’s or player’s effectiveness at preventing opposing teams from scoring, expressed as points allowed per 100 possessions(Lower is better)\nThe first scatterplot, Defensive Rating vs Career Length, plots each player’s best single-season defensive rating against their total number of NBA seasons played. This visualization reveals that while there is a large spread in defensive rating among players with short careers, those who have enjoyed the longest tenures—often more than a decade in the league—tend to have achieved strong defensive ratings at some point in their careers. However, not all long-career players were elite defenders; the plot also includes long careers among those with middling defensive ratings. The concentration of points between defensive ratings of 90 and 110, coupled with higher career season counts in this range, suggests that maintaining at least solid defensive performance is associated with greater career longevity.\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(\n  data = shared_plot1,\n  x = ~best_def_rating,\n  y = ~career_seasons,\n  text = ~paste(\"Player:\", PLAYER_NAME),\n  type = \"scatter\", mode = \"markers\",\n  marker = list(color = 'darkblue', opacity = 0.6)\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Defensive Rating vs Career Length\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Best Defensive Rating\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Career Seasons\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot2: Career Length by Defensive Tier\nTurning to the boxplot, Career Length by Defensive Rating Tier, the analysis focuses specifically on players who belong to the top 25% in terms of best defensive rating. The boxplot demonstrates that players in this elite defensive tier tend to have longer careers, with both the median and the upper range of career lengths notably higher compared to lower tiers (not shown here). The spread, however, shows variability: while some top defenders have short stints in the league, many enjoy careers spanning a decade or more. This pattern supports the idea that strong defensive ability can be a key factor in extending a player’s time in the NBA.\n\n\nCode\n# Top 25% defenders by DEF_RATING (lower is better)\ndef_rating_cut &lt;- quantile(career_length$best_def_rating, 1, na.rm = TRUE)\ncareer_length &lt;- career_length %&gt;%\n  mutate(def_tier = ifelse(best_def_rating &lt;= def_rating_cut, \"Top 25%\", \"Other\"))\n\np5 &lt;- ggplot(career_length, aes(x = def_tier, y = career_seasons, fill = def_tier)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Defensive Tier\", y = \"Career Length (Seasons)\",\n       title = \"Career Length by Defensive Rating Tier\") +\n  theme_minimal()\nggplotly(p5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot3: Median Defensive Rating by Era\nThe third visualization, Median Defensive Rating by Era, presents a longitudinal view of defensive rating trends over time, separated by player debut era (1990s, 2000s, 2010s+). The plot reveals that median defensive rating has generally increased (indicating less efficient defense league-wide), especially in recent seasons. Notably, the sharpest rise occurs after 2020, which may reflect broader offensive trends or rule changes that favor scoring. Despite differences between eras, the trajectories of each group are similar, highlighting the league-wide nature of these changes.\n\n\nCode\n# Add debut year to each player (first season)\nplayer_era &lt;- all_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(PLAYER_NAME_CLEAN) %&gt;%\n  summarize(debut_season = min(SEASON_CLEAN))\n\n# Merge back to all_data\nall_data_era &lt;- all_data %&gt;%\n  left_join(player_era, by = \"PLAYER_NAME_CLEAN\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(era = case_when(\n    debut_season &lt; \"2000-01\" ~ \"1990s\",\n    debut_season &lt; \"2010-11\" ~ \"2000s\",\n    TRUE ~ \"2010s+\"\n  ))\n\ndef_rating_trend &lt;- all_data_era %&gt;%\n  group_by(era, SEASON_CLEAN) %&gt;%\n  summarize(median_def_rating = median(DEF_RATING, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'era'.

    "text": "Data and Method\nTo address these questions, we drew on multiple sources of NBA regular season data, including player defensive metrics (steal percentage, defensive rating, win shares), usage data (total minutes played and usage rate), and salary records for each player-season. Data processing steps included standardizing player names and season formats, parsing salaries into numeric values, and merging the datasets based on player and season. An additional variable divided players into quartiles based on their hustle stat (Pct Steals), providing a categorical perspective for some of our visualizations.

    "text": "Results\n\nPlot1: Hustle Stat(Steal Percentage) vs. Salary\nPCT_STL: the percentage of opponent possessions that end with a steal by a player while they are on the court.\nThe first scatterplot, “Hustle Stat (Pct Steals) vs Salary,” reveals the relationship between steal percentage and player salary, with point color denoting total minutes played. The plot demonstrates that players with both low and moderate hustle stats can earn high salaries, and only a handful of high-salary players also post high steal percentages. Most high earners fall within the moderate hustle range, while many players with exceptional hustle stats receive only modest salaries. This lack of a strong positive correlation indicates that, while hustle stats may be valued, NBA salaries are determined by a broader range of factors, including offensive output, positional role, and market context. Players with high salaries and high minutes tend to cluster within moderate hustle stat ranges rather than at the extremes.\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(\n  data = shared_data,\n  x = ~PCT_STL, y = ~salary_num,\n  color = ~MIN,\n  text = ~paste(\"Player:\", PLAYER_NAME, \"&lt;br&gt;Salary:\", scales::dollar(salary_num)),\n  type = \"scatter\", mode = \"markers\"\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Hustle Stat vs Salary\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Pct Steals (Hustle)\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Salary (USD)\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot2: Hustle Stat(Steal Percentage) vs. Minutes Played\nThe second scatterplot, “Hustle Stat vs Minutes Played,” shifts the focus to how hustle stats relate to playing time, with point color now reflecting salary. Here, we see that players with higher hustle stats are found across the entire range of minutes played, and a visible cluster of higher-salary players occupies the middle range of hustle stats. The absence of a strong upward trend suggests that, while hustle is important, it is not the sole factor in determining playing time. In fact, some players with very high hustle stats do not necessarily play more minutes, reinforcing the notion that offensive skills, positional needs, and team strategies all play significant roles in shaping playing time.\n\n\nCode\nplot_ly(\n  data = shared_data,\n  x = ~PCT_STL, y = ~MIN,\n  color = ~salary_num,  # numeric = auto-color\n  text = ~paste(\"Player:\", PLAYER_NAME, \"&lt;br&gt;Salary:\", scales::dollar(salary_num)),\n  type = \"scatter\", mode = \"markers\"\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Hustle Stat vs Minutes Played\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Pct Steals (Hustle)\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Minutes Played\"),\n    coloraxis = list(colorbar = list(title = \"Salary\"))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot3: Minutes by Hustle Quartile\nThe third visualization, a boxplot of “Minutes Played by Hustle Quartile,” divides all players into four groups based on their steal percentage. This view shows that the median minutes played does rise slightly with each successive hustle quartile, indicating a mild positive association between hustle and playing time. However, the substantial overlap in the distribution of minutes played across quartiles and the wide interquartile ranges highlight that hustle alone does not dictate court time. Players in the lowest hustle quartile can still play significant minutes, further emphasizing the multifaceted decision-making that coaches employ when allocating playing time.\n\n\nCode\nshared_data$data(withSelection = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  mutate(hustle_quartile = ntile(PCT_STL, 4)) %&gt;%\n  SharedData$new(key = ~PLAYER_NAME) %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(\n    x = ~factor(hustle_quartile),\n    y = ~MIN,\n    type = \"box\",\n    boxpoints = \"outliers\",\n    text = ~paste(\"Player:\", PLAYER_NAME),\n    color = I(\"deepskyblue\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Minutes Played by Hustle Quartile\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"Hustle Quartile\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Minutes Played\")\n  )"

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nTaken together, these findings suggest that hustle metrics like steal percentage are only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to salary and minutes in the NBA. While there appears to be a mild association between higher hustle stats and increased playing time, the link is not strong, and there is little evidence to suggest that hustle alone drives salary decisions. Instead, salaries and minutes appear to be influenced by a complex interplay of skills, experience, team needs, and market dynamics. Hustle may earn a player more opportunities, but it is not sufficient in isolation."

    "text": "Limitations\nIt is important to note several limitations in this analysis. The data is restricted to regular season performance and does not capture playoff contributions or intangible qualities that may be valued by coaching staff but are not recorded in standard statistics. The focus on steal percentage as the primary hustle metric is also a limitation, as other hustle-related stats such as deflections, loose ball recoveries, or charges drawn could provide a more holistic assessment. Additionally, NBA salary is affected by many factors outside of on-court performance, including years of experience, team salary cap situations, and free agency market conditions, which this analysis does not control for."

    "text": "Future Work\nFuture research could expand this study by incorporating a wider array of hustle metrics to capture defensive and effort-based contributions more comprehensively. Using multivariate regression could help control for confounding variables such as position, age, and offensive output, providing a clearer picture of the true impact of hustle on salary and minutes played. Exploring trends over time could reveal whether hustle metrics are becoming more valued in the era of advanced analytics. Finally, including postseason data and qualitative assessments from coaches or front offices could help further contextualize the value placed on hustle in team decision-making. This multifaceted approach would offer a deeper understanding of how effort, skill, and opportunity intersect in shaping NBA careers."

    "text": "Results\n\n1. Evolution of 3-Point Attempts Among Big Men\nMethod We calculated the average number of 3-point attempts per game (3PA/G) for each player and grouped them by official position (Center or Power Forward), based on data from player_index.csv. Players were filtered to exclude those with 0 games played or 0 three-point attempts to prevent skewed results. We then aggregated these values by season, using a weighted average based on games played (GP), to ensure high-minute players had more influence than benchwarmers. This allowed us to visualize year-by-year trends in 3-point shooting by position over the past four decades.\n\n\nCode\ndecade_formatter &lt;- function(x) {\n  ifelse(x %% 10 == 0, paste0(\"'\", substr(as.character(x), 3, 4), \"s\"), \"\")\n}\n\ntrend_plot &lt;- ggplot(big_men_avg_by_season, \n                     aes(x = season_year, y = avg_3pa_per_game, color = position_group)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1980, 2020, 5), labels = decade_formatter) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"3PA per Game: Centers vs Power Forwards\",\n    subtitle = \"Average 3PA by season (1980–2020)\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"3PA per Game\",\n    color = \"Position\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Make the plot interactive\nggplotly(trend_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation: This plot now correctly shows a steady rise in 3-point attempts per game among both centers and power forwards from 1980 through 2023. Power forwards led the way, gradually increasing 3PA over the decades, while centers started catching up notably post-2010. The post-2015 era reflects modern “stretch bigs” being embedded in team strategies. This trend supports the narrative of positional fluidity and league-wide spacing strategies.\n\n\n2. Decade-by-Decade Comparison\nMethod In this analysis, we compare the average number of 3-point attempts per game (3PA) by decade for centers and power forwards. The data is grouped by decade and player position, with the average number of 3-point attempts calculated using a weighted average based on games played (GP). This ensures that players with more playing time have a more significant impact on the average.\n##To calculate this, we: 1. Grouped the data by decade and position (Center or Power Forward). 2. Calculated the average number of 3-point attempts per game for each group. 3. Used the geom_col function to create a bar chart that visualizes the average 3-point attempts by decade for each position.\n\n\nCode\ndecade_plot &lt;- ggplot(big_men_avg_by_decade, aes(x = decade, y = avg_3pa_per_game, fill = position_group)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  #geom_text(aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f\", avg_3pa_per_game)), vjust = -0.5, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average 3PA per Game by Decade\",\n    subtitle = \"Grouped by official player position\",\n    x = \"Decade\",\n    y = \"3PA per Game\",\n    fill = \"Position\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# interactive\nggplotly(decade_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Averaging over decades smooths out year-by-year variation and reinforces what the first graph suggests: Power forwards have consistently led in 3PA, but centers have more than tripled their 3-point volume over time. This aligns with the emergence of players like Brook Lopez, Al Horford, and Nikola Jokić, who redefine what it means to play the center position in a spacing-heavy modern NBA."

The upward trajectory confirms this is not just a stylistic anomaly, but a sustained league-wide evolution."
