# High-level goal
To create an interactive website using quarto website that enables visual analysis of NBA player and team data to uncover key factors affecting performance and career longevity.

# Description of your goals
This project aims to explore under-analyzed trends in NBA player performance, emphasizing hustle stats, defensive impact, injury risk, and the evolving role of big men. The motivation behind this analysis is to uncover hidden patterns that traditional stats might overlook, using interactive and insightful visualizations.

Dataset: https://github.com/Brescou/NBA-dataset-stats-player-team/tree/mainThis repository contains a rich and diverse dataset spanning from 1996 to 2023, drawn from NBA game statistics. It's ideal for data analysts, basketball fans, researchers, and anyone interested in the detailed numbers behind the sport.

We'll use these data to answer questions like:

- Do hustle stats correlate with long-term playing time or salary?
- Are strong defenders more likely to remain in the league across different eras?
- How has the evolution of the 3-point shot affected big men over time?
- how player usage and performance metrics relate to salary and team success in the NBA Playoffs.
