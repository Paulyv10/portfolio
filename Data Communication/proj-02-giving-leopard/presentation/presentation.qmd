## Introduction

- **Objective**: Explore what aspects have changed for nba players through out decades and how NBA player value is reflected through performance, salary, and longevity.
- **Motivation**: NBA contracts are massive — but do they align with effort, impact, or results?
  - Are hustle stats rewarded with minutes or salaries?
  - Do top defenders enjoy longer careers?
  - Does playoff impact correlate with winning or salary?
  - How have big men’s roles evolved with the rise of 3-point shooting?

---

## What We Built

- A **multi-page interactive Quarto website** with:
  - **Dynamic filters** (season, team)
  - **Interactive plots** using `plotly` + `crosstalk`
  - Linked pages exploring different dimensions of player value

---

## Page 1: Hustle Stats vs. Salary

- Focus: Do players who excel in **steals** (Pct Steals) get paid more or play more?

### Visualizations:
1. **Steals vs Salary**: Colored by minutes played
2. **Steals vs Minutes**: Colored by salary
3. **Boxplot by Hustle Quartile**: Do higher hustle players play more?

### Key Method:
- `SharedData` + `filter_select()` to allow **interactive team/season filtering**

---

## Page 2: Defense vs Career Longevity

- Focus: How do **defensive performance metrics** affect career length?

### Visualizations:
1. **Defensive Rating vs Career Seasons**
2. **Boxplot: Career Length by Defensive Tier**
3. **Median Defensive Rating Over Time by Era**

---

## Page 2: Defense vs Career Longevity

### Methods:
- Grouped players by era and calculated career stats
- Used lowest defensive rating (best) and avg. win shares

### Takeaway:
- Better defenders **tend to last longer**, especially those in top quartile
- Defensive skill is a **strong predictor of longevity**

---

## Page 3: Big Men & 3s — Evolution Over Decades

- Focus: How have 3-point shooting roles for **centers and power forwards** evolved?

### Visualizations:
1. **3PA per Game over Time**: Shows steady rise from 1980 to 2023
2. **Decade-by-Decade Barplot**: Average 3PA by position, weighted by games played
3. **Bigs’ Share of 3PA**: % of all 3PA from centers and PFs

---

## Page 3: Big Men & 3s — Evolution Over Decades

### Methods:
- Grouped players by position and decade
- Used weighted averages to reflect playing time
- Computed bigs’ total 3PA as a share of league totals

### Takeaway:
- Power Forwards led the transition early, but Centers caught up post-2015
- Big men now contribute **50% of total league 3PAs**

---

## Page 4: Playoff Salary vs. Performance Metrics

- Focus: How do salary, usage rate, and PIE(Player Impact Estimate) relate to each other and to team playoff success?

### Visualizations:
1. **Salary vs Usage Rate** (interactive with filters)
2. **Salary vs PIE** (interactive)
3. **Usage & Salary vs Team Win %** (interactive, high-usage sample)

---

## Page 4: Playoff Salary vs Performance Metrics

### Methods:
- Added decade labels and filters for era comparisons
- Applied regression lines and tooltips for interpretation

### Takeaway:
- Salary is loosely correlated with usage and PIE
- **Playoff success** does **not strongly correlate** with salary 
- Usage and PIE rise in the modern era, reflecting shifts in offensive roles

---

## Design Considerations

- Used **interactivity where it supports exploration**
- Highlighted **statistical relationships**, not just raw data

### Implementation Tools:
- `tidyverse` for wrangling
- `plotly` for rich, interactive charts
- `crosstalk` for lightweight dropdown filtering
- `Quarto` for integrated documentation + publishing

## Insights

- **Effort metrics** like hustle and defense **correlate** with minutes and longevity, but not always with pay
- **High usage or impact** does not guarantee playoff success — many other team factors matter
- **Big men’s roles** have radically changed — 3-point shooting is now essential
- **High usage or salary** does not guarantee playoff success — many other team factors matter
- Our tool lets users **generate their own insights** by filtering, comparing seasons and teams
