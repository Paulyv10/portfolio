Viewers answered survey questions about 4 coffees they ordered from Cometeer for the tasting. Lastly, Data blogger Robert McKeon Aloe analyzed the data in November 2023.\nThe dataset has 57 variables and 4,042 entries. \n\nThere are demographic variables including age, gender, ethnicity, education level, employment status, number of children and political affiliation. \nThe dataset also explores coffee consumption habits like number of cups of coffee consumed daily, typical locations, brewing methods, places to purchase coffee, favorite coffee drink, typical additions to coffee, type of dairy, and type of sweetener.\nIt also briefly explores coffee preferences like preferred style, strength, roast level, and caffeine level.\nFurthermore, participants were asked to evaluate their coffee expertise and tasting evaluation levels on numeric scales. They self-rated their expertise and then rated the bitterness, acidity, personal preference, and notes of each of the 4 coffees. They were also asked which was their favorite coffee out of the 4 options.\nParticipants were also asked about their work and lifestyle like whether they work from home, their reasons for drinking coffee, whether they like the taste of coffee, and know about the coffee’s origin.\nLastly, the survey asked about their coffee spending and values like monthly spending on coffee, highest price paid as well as maximum price willing to pay for a cup of coffee, perceived value of coffee purchased at a cafe, money spent perceived value on purchased coffee equipment.\n\nThe reason for choosing this dataset is because it is a comprehensive source of information about coffee consumption habits, preferences, and demographic factors. Having such a wide variety of questions allows us to align with the project’s intention to answer two distinct questions without overlapping variables. Furthermore, it includes both numerical and categorical variables, which aligns with our intention to work with both types of variables. To add on, the dataset provides a mix of subjective ratings and objective characteristics, making it ideal for exploring different patterns in consumer behavior. Lastly, each member of the group has a personal connection to coffee, making the dataset appealing to explore and learn from.\n\ncoffee_survey &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-05-14/coffee_survey.csv')\n\nRows: 4042 Columns: 57\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (44): submission_id, age, cups, where_drink, brew, brew_other, purchase,...\ndbl (13): expertise, coffee_a_bitterness, coffee_a_acidity, coffee_a_persona...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message."

    "text": "Questions\nThe first question we want to answer is How does coffee spending vary based on demographic and lifestyle factors? We are interested in learning about how spending patterns change across different groups, influenced by factors like work habits, and personal values. The variables involved are:\nCategorical (Demographics & Coffee Preferences):\n\ngender (self-identified gender)\nethnicity_race (self-identified ethnicity)\neducation_level (highest level of education completed)\nemployment_status (current work status)\nwfh (whether the participant works from home or in person)\nstyle (general coffee preference before the tasting)\n\nNumerical (Age and Spending):\n\nage\nmost_paid (highest price ever paid for coffee)\nmost_willing (maximum price willing to pay)\ntotal_spend (monthly coffee spending)\n\nThe second question to answer is How do coffee preferences relate to where people typically drink coffee (home, work, or elsewhere)? We want to understand how people’s coffee preferences differ depending on where they drink their coffee. The variables involved are:\nCategorical (Coffee Preferences & Location):\n\nwhere_drink (Where do you typically drink coffee? Home, work, elsewhere)\nstyle (Before today’s tasting, which of the following best describes what kind of coffee you like?)\ndairy (What kind of dairy do you add?)\nsweetener (What kind of sugar or sweetener do you add?)\nwfh (Do you work from home or in person?)\n\nNumerical (Preferences):\n\nstrength (How strong do you like your coffee?)\nroast_level (What roast level of coffee do you prefer?)\nexpertise (How would you rate your own coffee expertise?)\ntotal_spend (How much do you typically spend on coffee each month?)\n\nWe will not be connecting the first question to the second question. Specifically, we will not be discussing how multiple demographic factors interact with coffee preferences and drinking location. Instead, we will be strictly focusing on spending and demographic factors for the first question and coffee preferences and drinking location for the second question."

    "text": "Analysis plan\nFor the first question, the plan is to group participants by demographic categories and compare their coffee spending habits. We will analyze whether factors like education level, employment status, and working from home influence spending. We can also explore if coffee preferences, such as preferred style, are associated with higher or lower spending. Some specific methods are:\n\nDescriptive Statistics: We will calculate means and medians for total_spend across demographic groups to identify trends and differences between groups. For example, one group may consistently spend more than another, suggesting a possible connection between lifestyle factors and coffee expenses.\nComparative Analysis: We are considering boxplots and violin plots be used to visualize spending distributions across different categories (e.g., employment_status, wfh, education_level). This might reveal differences in spending behavior, such as one group having a wider range of coffee expenditures or distinct spending patterns.\n\nFor the second question, we will group participants by where they typically drink their coffee (home, work, elsewhere) and compare their preferences for coffee strength, roast level. We can also analyze how different locations influence the addition of dairy and sweeteners. Additionally, we will examine if wfh (whether people work from home or in person) influences their coffee preferences or spending habits, as well as whether coffee expertise or monthly coffee spending correlates with where people prefer to drink their coffee. Specifically:\n\nDescriptive Statistics: We will compute summary statistics like the mean and median for strength, roast_level, and expertise by where_drink categories. This will help identify patterns, like whether people who drink coffee at home prefer a lighter roast compared to those who drink at work.\nComparative Analysis: We will use bar charts to compare categorical preferences. For example, we could compare preferences for dairy and sweetener across different drinking locations.\n\nWe do acknowledge that the dataset contains many variables. We will be filtering the dataset into two for the first and second questions. Within these, some entries may have missing or inconsistent data. We will be handling these by dropping the entries that do not have every variable we require for the first or second question. Since our dataset is relatively large with 4,042 entries, we expect that removing rows with missing values will not significantly impact our results.\nWe also understand that correlation does not mean causation. As a result, our analysis will focus on finding patterns rather than proving one thing causes another. For example, if people who work from home spend more on coffee, it doesn’t necessarily mean that working from home is the reason—they might have different incomes or habits that affect their spending. To keep our findings accurate, we will use statistics to look at relationships between factors while being careful not to assume one thing directly causes another."

    "text": "Question 1 &lt;- Update title to relate to the question you’re answering\n\nIntroduction\nThis plot explores the relationship between coffee spending and demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender. To answer the question of how coffee spending varies across these factors, we need spending data broken down by demographic categories. Specifically, the dataset must include variables for average coffee spending, self-reported ethnicity/race, and gender identity. These variables allow us to compare spending trends among different groups and analyze whether certain demographics spend more on coffee than others.\nThis question is interesting because coffee culture is a major part of daily life, with spending habits influenced by factors like income, lifestyle, cultural background, and accessibility. Understanding these patterns could be useful for businesses in the coffee industry, marketers, or researchers studying consumer behavior. Additionally, it can highlight economic disparities or cultural preferences in coffee consumption. The dataset visualized in this plot helps reveal these insights by showing how different groups allocate their budgets toward coffee purchases.\n\n\nApproach\nTo explore how coffee spending varies across demographic groups, we have the option of creating two types of plots: a line plot and a boxplot. The line plot effectively visualizes spending trends across different ethnic and racial groups, with separate lines for each gender category. This allows for easy comparison of spending patterns and highlights variations in spending habits. The use of color mapping helps differentiate gender categories, making it clear which groups tend to spend more or less on coffee.\nIn addition to the line plot, we can create a boxplot to display the distribution of coffee spending across different demographic groups. A boxplot is ideal for capturing the range, median, and variability of spending, which helps identify outliers and differences in spending behavior between groups. By faceting the boxplot by gender or another relevant variable, we can provide a clearer comparison of spending patterns within subgroups.\nAfter evaluating both options, we’ve decided to create the line plot since we can only create one plot per problem. It’s clear and concise, but also allows for some creative liberty when it comes to telling our story using stylistic features surrounding the theme of coffee.\n\n\nAnalysis\n(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed) In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe line plot we created reveals variations in coffee spending across different racial and ethnic groups, segmented by gender. One key trend is that spending habits fluctuate significantly across groups, with some demographics showing much higher variability than others. For instance, individuals identifying as “prefer not to say” tend to have the highest spending, particularly among white/Caucasian respondents. Meanwhile, spending among Hispanic/Latino and Native American/Alaska Native respondents is consistently lower across most gender categories.\nThe differences in spending patterns may be influenced by various social and economic factors, such as cultural preferences, income levels, and lifestyle choices. The relatively high spending among some groups might be tied to factors like urban living, social norms around coffee consumption, or disposable income. On the other hand, lower spending groups may have different beverage preferences or economic constraints that limit discretionary purchases like coffee. The data also suggests that gender plays a role, as males and females often follow distinct spending patterns within each racial/ethnic group. However, the differences are not always consistent, indicating that other factors beyond gender may also be at play in shaping coffee consumption habits."

    "text": "1. How does coffee spending vary based on demographic and lifestyle factors?\n\nIntroduction\nThe question explores the relationship between coffee spending and demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender. To answer the question, we broke down spending data by demographic categories to focus on how coffee spending varies across these factors. Specifically, for the demographic factors, we used the dataset’s average coffee spending, self-reported ethnicity/race, and gender identity. We chose these broad demographic features because they provide a broader perspective on social and cultural influences on coffee spending. By narrowing it down to two demographic variables, we aimed to analyze whether certain populations spend more on coffee than others.\nWe were influenced by our own relationships to coffee culture and how it plays a major part of daily life. We believe that spending habits to fuel coffee drinking are influenced by factors like income, lifestyle, cultural background, and accessibility. Understanding spending patterns for certain populations like ethnicity or gender-identity could be useful for businesses in the coffee industry, marketers, or researchers studying consumer behavior. Additionally, it can highlight economic disparities or cultural preferences in coffee consumption. The dataset visualized in this plot helps reveal these insights by showing how different groups allocate their budgets toward coffee purchases.\n\n\nApproach\n(1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nTo explore how coffee spending varies across demographic groups, we considered two types of plots: a line plot and a boxplot. The latter would allow us to observe the distribution of coffee spending within each ethnic/gender group, easily visualizing the range, median, quartiles, and potential outliers. It would also be useful to identify whether specific demographic groups have more coffee spending variability. This could reveal diverse coffee consumption behaviors within the same category. However, with both gender and ethnicity included in the analysis, we realized that a boxplot would become cluttered and harder to interpret, making it less effective for identifying overall trends.\nWe ultimately decided that a line plot would be a more effective visualization for this question. Since we are focusing on average spending trends rather than distributional characteristics, a line plot provides a clearer and more intuitive way to compare spending across different demographic groups. We plotted the coffee spending according to the demographic group and used color mapping for gender identity, giving us enough creative liberty to tell a coffee spending story while ensuring visual clarity. Furthermore, unlike a boxplot, which can sometimes be complex to interpret, the line plot ensures that key insights like understanding which groups spend the most or least on coffee is immediately apparent. This makes it the best choice for conveying our findings in a straightforward and impactful way.\n\n\nAnalysis\n(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed) In this section, provide the code that generates your plots.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\nThe line plot we created reveals variations in coffee spending across different racial and ethnic groups, segmented by gender. One key trend is that spending habits fluctuate significantly across groups, with some demographics showing much higher variability than others. For instance, individuals identifying as “prefer not to say” tend to have the highest spending, particularly among white/Caucasian respondents. Meanwhile, spending among Hispanic/Latino and Native American/Alaska Native respondents is consistently lower across most gender categories. In general, the gender-based spending trends within each ethnic group are not uniform. This may suggest that the differences in spending patterns may be influenced by various social and economic factors, such as cultural preferences, income levels, and lifestyle choices.\nHigher spending among certain groups may be linked to factors like urban living, social coffee culture, or higher disposable income, whereas lower spending may reflect alternative beverage preferences, budget constraints, or lower coffee accessibility. The data also suggests that gender plays a role, as males and females often follow distinct spending patterns within each racial/ethnic group. However, the differences are not always consistent, indicating that other factors beyond gender may also be at play in shaping coffee consumption habits."

Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nWe are aiming to use the dataset to explore how work-from-home status influences both coffee preferences and coffee spending. We are going to use categorical data “wfh” (work-from-home status) and “style” (coffee preference) alongside the numerical variable “total_spend” (monthly coffee spending) to explore individuals who primarily work from home, in person, or a mix of both favor different coffee styles or spend differently on coffee.\nWe are interested in this question because remote work became a major part of daily life during the pandemic and has remained a long-term shift for many people. With more people working from home, their lifestyle, including coffee habits, is likely to change. We want to explore how this shift in lifestyle has influenced consumer behavior and preferences in the coffee market, whether remote workers tend to spend more or less on coffee, and if their taste preferences differ from those who primarily work in person.\n\n\nApproach\n(1-2 paragraphs) Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question.

This plot offers an ideal visualization for comparing how coffee spending varies across different work environments while also factoring in coffee preferences.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\nIn the first plot, total coffee spending fluctuates across different work styles, with certain coffee preferences, such as Juicy, Floral, Bold, and Sweet, showing more variation. Notably, individuals who prefer Juicy and Sweet coffee styles have the highest average spending among hybrid workers, with Juicy reaching the highest spending at $55. Bold coffee has its highest average spending among remote workers, while Floral coffee is most popular among in-person workers, with spending peaking at around $53.\nOn the other hand, Nutty, Full-bodied, and Caramelized coffee styles show relatively consistent spending across all work styles, suggesting that these preferences are less influenced by whether someone works remotely or in an office. These trends highlight that certain coffee styles may be more tied to lifestyle choices, while others remain stable regardless of work environment."

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\nThe plot shows the total coffee spending fluctuates across different work styles, with certain coffee preferences, such as Juicy, Floral, Bold, and Sweet, showing more variation. Notably, individuals who prefer Juicy and Sweet coffee styles have the highest average spending among hybrid workers, with Juicy reaching the highest spending at $55. Bold coffee has its highest average spending among remote workers, while Floral coffee is most popular among in-person workers, with spending peaking at around $53.\nOn the other hand, Nutty, Full-bodied, and Caramelized coffee styles show relatively consistent spending across all work styles, suggesting that these preferences are less influenced by whether someone works remotely or in an office. These trends highlight that certain coffee styles may be more tied to lifestyle choices, while others remain stable regardless of work environment."

    "text": "Dataset Introduction\nOur dataset, “The Great American Coffee Taste Test,” originates from a YouTube event hosted by world champion barista James Hoffmann and the coffee company Cometeer in October 2023. Participants answered survey questions about four coffees they ordered for the tasting, as well as their coffee preferences and consumption habits. In November 2023, data blogger Robert McKeon Aloe analyzed the results. The dataset includes 4,042 entries across 57 variables, covering factors like consumption habits, expertise, and spending. With both subjective ratings and objective characteristics, the dataset is well-suited for analyzing consumer behavior patterns.\nBeyond its analytical value, we chose this dataset because we all share a deep interest in coffee culture and are curious about how others experience and enjoy it. We seek to explore consumer behavior and test popular stereotypes about coffee consumption, such as whether certain demographics prefer specific brewing methods, or whether one gender tends to spend more on coffee than another."

    "text": "Question 1: How Does Coffee Spending Vary Based On Gender, Ethnicity, and Race?\n\nIntroduction\nThis question examines how coffee spending varies by gender and ethnicity/race. To answer it, we used three variables: gender, ethnicity_race, and total_spend, with total_spend representing the average monthly expenditure on coffee. Our interest in this topic stems from our own connections to coffee culture and its significance in daily life. Specifically, we wanted to explore whether demographic characteristics influence coffee spending habits.\n\n\nApproach\nTo explore how coffee spending varies across demographic groups, we decided to explore both a line plot and a boxplot to gain different insights and evaluate their strengths and findings. The boxplot helps us understand the distribution of spending within each demographic group, highlighting the range, median, quartiles, and outliers. Meanwhile, the line plot is useful for visualizing overall trends across groups, making it easier to compare patterns between gender and ethnicity.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThis code bloack loads the data and contains general data cleaning:\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  gender    ethnicity_race education_level employment_status wfh     style age  \n  &lt;chr&gt;

Since we are focusing on average spending trends rather than distributional characteristics, a line plot provides a clearer and more intuitive way to compare spending across different demographic groups. We plotted the coffee spending according to the demographic group and used color mapping for gender identity, giving us enough creative liberty to tell a coffee spending story while ensuring visual clarity.\nThe most noticeable trend is that spending patterns vary significantly across demographic groups. For instance, female Native American individuals report the highest average spending, while non-binary Hispanic individuals report the lowest. Male respondents tend to have relatively consistent spending across racial/ethnic groups, while female and non-binary respondents show more variation.\nHowever, these results should not be generalized because the dataset contains uneven sample sizes among racial/ethnic groups, making the findings less reliable. Some groups have fewer respondents, which exacerbates differences and may produce misleading trends. This is especially evident with the missing data for Black and Native American non-binary category, since there were no responses from these groups."

    "text": "Question 2: How does work arrangement (wfh, hybrid, or in-person) influence coffee taste preferences and spending habits?\n\nIntroduction\nThis questions aims to explore how work arrangement influences both coffee preferences and coffee spending. To analyze this, we used the following variables:\nwfh - Categorizes respondents as working from home, in-person, or a mix of both (hybrid).\nstyle - Captures coffee flavor preferences.\navg_total_spend – Represents total monthly coffee spending per style.\nWe were motivated by the recent widespread shift to remote work, which became a defining trend during the pandemic and has remained a lasting change for many industries. With more people working from home, their lifestyle, including coffee habits, is likely to change. We want to explore how this shift in lifestyle has influenced consumer behavior and preferences in the coffee market, whether remote workers tend to spend more or less on coffee, and if their taste preferences differ from those who primarily work in person.\n\n\nApproach\nTo explore how work arrangements influence coffee preferences and spending, we considered two types of plots: a bar plot and a line plot. A line plot could help us observe trends in average coffee spending across different work arrangements for the 10 coffee styles. However, since the work-from-home (wfh) status is a categorical variable with only three distinct options, a line plot is not the most effective way to compare these categories. Lines typically demonstrate a continuous relationship, which does not exist between discrete work arrangements. Additionally, with multiple coffee styles plotted together, the overlapping lines create visual clutter, making it harder to interpret individual trends compared to a bar plot.\nWe ultimately chose a bar plot as the most effective visualization. A bar plot allows for a clear comparison of average coffee spending across multiple categories, such as work arrangement and coffee style preferences. To enhance readability, we grouped the style bars by work arrangement, making it easier to observe how coffee preferences vary within each work setting. Additionally, we used color mapping and annotations to distinguish between different coffee styles and ensure spending values are clearly communicated. This approach highlights key trends in both spending and preferences while maintaining clarity and interpretability, making the bar plot the best choice for visualizing our findings.\n\n\nAnalysis\nThis code block contains code for line plot:\n\n############################################\n######### LINE PLOT FOR QUESTION 2

hybrid workers averaging $45.12, remote workers $45.04, and in-person workers $43.47. However, spending on specific coffee styles varies by work setting.\n\nHybrid workers spend the most on a single style, with Juicy coffee ($55.23) leading their preferences.\nIn-person workers favor Floral coffee ($52.79), possibly influenced by café culture or office coffee habits.\nRemote workers spend the most on Bright coffee ($51.69), which may reflect a preference for lighter, refreshing flavors at home.\n\nMeanwhile, Nutty, Full-bodied, and Caramelized styles show consistent spending across all work settings, suggesting they are popular everyday choices rather than specialty indulgences. While work arrangement influences coffee style preferences, total coffee spending remains relatively stable, highlighting that coffee habits are diverse across all groups."
